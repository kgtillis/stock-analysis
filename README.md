# Challenge

Created a macro to analyze stock information for an entered year. The macro pulls and stores the starting & ending prices, calculates return and the sum of the total volumes, and displays the Total Volume and Return Percentage in a separate sheet for each stock. 

For the year 2018 of entered stocks, only ENPH and RUN tickers have the highest returns. In the previous year 2017, only TERP had a negative return while the other stocks returned positive. From 2017 to 2018, ENPH was able to maintain their positive return rate, and RUN had the highest increase from 5% to 84%.
